## FPGAOL User Examples

#### [fpgaol](fpgaol1)

\*Only available for registered/campus users

Be aware the clock frequency is 100 MHz(as on Nexys A7)

#### [fpgaol2](fpgaol2)

\*Available for guests

Be aware the clock frequency is 50 MHz!

#### [RISC-V SoC(quasiSoC)](quasisoc_examples)

Based on regymm's personal project https://github.com/regymm/quasiSoC/ 

For both fpgaol1 and fpgaol2, pre-built bitstream and binaries for testing the platform. 
Flip the rightmost switch after uploading bitstream, you should see the 4 LEDs on the right side "blinking" and some UART output. Refresh the page(no need to re-upload bitstream) if not.
